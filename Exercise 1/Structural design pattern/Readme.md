Structural Design Patterns
1. Adapter Pattern: Voltage Adapter
Scenario: A voltage adapter that allows a 110V appliance to be used with a 220V power supply.

Overview
The Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects. This pattern allows classes to work together that could not
otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. It is particularly useful in a scenario where a 110V appliance needs to operate with a 220V power supply, ensuring
compatibility without altering the existing appliance design.

2. Decorator Pattern: Pizza Toppings
Scenario: Adding extra toppings (Cheese, Pepperoni) to a basic pizza dynamically.

Overview
The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending 
functionality. This pattern is particularly useful in a scenario where you want to add various toppings to a basic pizza at runtime, allowing customization of
the pizza without modifying the original pizza class.
