Creational Design Patterns
1. Factory Method Pattern: Fantasy Creature Creator
Scenario: A fantasy world where you can create different types of fantasy creatures.

Overview
The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern promotes 
loose coupling by eliminating the need to bind application-specific classes into the code. It is particularly useful in a scenario where a fantasy world requires 
the dynamic creation of various types of creatures (e.g., dragons, elves, orcs), allowing for easy extension and maintenance without modifying existing code.

2. Builder Pattern: Custom Robot Assembly
Scenario: Assembling a custom robot with different parts.

Overview
The Builder Pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different 
representations. This pattern is particularly useful in a scenario where a custom robot needs to be assembled with various parts (e.g., arms, legs, sensors),
providing a step-by-step approach to create complex objects while ensuring that the final object is consistent and complete.
