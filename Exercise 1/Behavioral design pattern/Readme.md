Behavioral Design Patterns
1. Observer Pattern: Recipe Updates
Scenario: A cooking blog where subscribers receive updates whenever a new recipe is posted.

Overview
The Observer Pattern is used to define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, 
all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. This is particularly useful in a scenario where multiple subscribers 
need to receive updates about new recipes posted on a cooking blog.

2. Command Pattern: Smart Home System
Scenario: A smart home system where users can execute commands to control smart devices like lights.

Overview
The Command Pattern is used to encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. 
It provides a way to decouple the sender of a request from its receiver, giving greater flexibility in assigning, sequencing, and executing requests.
